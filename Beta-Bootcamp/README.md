# About the Bootcamp

The Beta Bootcamp is the first Bootcamp of the Learning Team. It has a cohort size of 15 that were selected from a pool of very strong applicants.

The Bootcamp will serve as a stepping stone for the Learning Team towards Bootcamps with much larger cohort size.

## Schedule

The structure of the schedule is as follow:

1. 3 weeks of active learning based on notebooks 1 - 7 of the PySyft tutorials.
2. 1 week for review and to introduce participants to example of projects that can be worked from what has been learned.
3. If participants wish, they can work on an optional demo project. They will have two weeks to complete the project.
