<h1 id='about-the-learning-team'>About the Learning Team</h1>

We are an OpenMined Education Team. Our goal is to empower the advancement and adoption of Privacy Enhancing Technologies by offering a high quality and low barrier-to-entry learning experience.

We achieve this mainly through structured learning initiatives such as bootcamps and this Beta bootcamp is our first launch.

Our goal during this bootcamp is to introduce you to Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) and get you started with the OpenMined PPML library, PySyft. We also hope to learn from your feedback to be able to improve and better serve you, the OpenMined community, and future learners. To achieve this, we will post a survey each week for you to tell us how we are doing. 

Let's run this experiment and learn together! 
(You'll learn PPML from us, we'll learn how to deliver a high quality open-source education experience from you!) ðŸ˜ƒ

<h1 id=#about-the-bootcamp>About the Bootcamp</h1>

The Beta Bootcamp is the first bootcamp of the Learning Team. It has a cohort size of 15 that were selected from a pool of very strong applicants.

The bootcamp will serve as a stepping stone for the Learning Team towards bootcamps with much larger cohort size and new courses / content.

<h2 id='schedule'>Schedule</h2>

The bootcamp will last approximately 4 weeks. Participants who wish to work on the capstone project will work ~2 more weeks after the end of the bootcamp.

1. **Three weeks of active learning** based on notebooks 1 - 8 of the PySyft tutorials.
2. **One week for review** and to introduce participants to example of projects that can be worked from what has been learned.
3. **Participants can work on a final project** with the help and support of members of the team.

If you have expressed, in your application, the desire to receive one-on-one technical mentorship during the bootcamp you will be matched with one of the Technical Mentors below. 

If you are not contacted by your mentor by August 3rd, please DM the Learning Team Lead (@Yemi).

**Recommendation for Technical Questions:** Although you can ask such questions to your mentor via private message, we strongly recommend that you post them in the bootcamp's channel (#edu_beta_bootcamp) and ping your mentor.
